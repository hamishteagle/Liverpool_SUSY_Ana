README for the Root Directory.

Directory contains all of the source files for the MyxAODAnalysis package.

MCChecks.cxx  	    - Performs Overlap removal between Sherpa W/Z/DiBoson samples. Can be used to set up any MC specific code on an event by event basis (or in the initalise function)


mctlib.cxx     	    - mct library


MyxAODAnalysis.cxx  - Source code containing the event loop algorithm. Uses the header files in MyAnalysis for objects/variables/trees etc.


ObjectDef.cxx  	    - Sets up the object definitions using SUSYTools. If object definitions change, only this source code needs to change (interfaces with SUSYToolsObjDef tool)


PreliminarySel.cxx  - Performs a preliminary selection to decide if events fall into certain 'interesting' regions (CRW, SRA etc). Selections can be tightened in here for running with Systematics


TMctLib.cxx         - ROOT interface to the mctLibrary (converts TLorentzVector to array [4])


TreeService.cxx     - Initialises the output trees. Any additional variables to be placed in the output tree should be initialised here, and assigned in the fill function of the class. 


VariableCalc.cxx    - Specific class for calculating variables. Some general variables (mCT, mT etc) are already calculated in the PreliminarySel class. However this is used for further calculations 
		      depending on which region we are in.
