README for the share/ Directory

Any local files that needs to be accessed while running on the grid should be placed in the share directory. For example the Good Run List.

When using the path to these files in the source code, it should be called as below:

const char* grlFilePath = "$ROOTCOREBIN/data/MyAnalysis/data12_8TeV.periodAllYear_DetStatus-v61-pro14-02_DQDefects-00-01-00_PHYS_StandardGRL_All_Good.xml";
const char* fullGRLFilePath = gSystem->ExpandPathName (grlFilePath); 

(further example of usage is in the MyxAODAnalysis.cxx source code)
